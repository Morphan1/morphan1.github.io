## A Sleek New Site
Hello, and welcome to my new and improved website! Rather than designing and hosting it myself and coming up with custom blog systems, I've moved to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which uses Markdown and is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
<br><br>
# The Plan
My current plan is to try to write a few blog posts on here every now and then.
Most of them will be programming-oriented, and a lot will likely just be nonsense about whatever I'm working on at the time.
<br><br>
# Current State
Right now, I don't have too much content to offer, but check out my GitHub (linked at the bottom of the site) to see what public projects I'm working on.
