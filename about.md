#### Who is Morphan1?
I am *Connor Branan*, better known as Morphan1 --- a professional programmer and COO (Chief Operating Officer) of the video game design and software engineering startup [Frenetic LLC].

In 2011, I became interested in web design and learned the basics of HTML and JavaScript. Not too long after, I made my first ambitious attempt at creating a multiplayer game within the browser. It used a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) backend with scripts I had crafted myself.

Two years later, I joined an IRC chat for a Minecraft server-side scripting plugin called [Denizen](https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen-For-Bukkit). Fascinated by the plugin's open source Java code and eager to learn, it was here that I finally took up programming as a true hobby. After a while of occasional contributions --- some better than others --- to the plugin, as well as its (affectionately named) IRC bot [spazzmatic](https://github.com/Jeebiss/spazz/), I officially joined the Denizen team.

As part of that team, I learned the ins and outs of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and formed lasting bonds with members of the community. Since then, I've become experienced with both Java and C# --- though I heavily prefer the latter.

#### What's Next?
I'm currently teaching myself C++ as well as reverse engineering skills by way of modding games. As COO of [Frenetic LLC], I'm constantly working on private codebases that will eventually be released for the enjoyment of all.

If there's one thing I've learned from my experiences, it's that you never stop learning in this field. No matter how much you think you know, there will always be more to learn. That's what makes it so fun.

As someone who can never have too many projects, I'm always willing to consider independent opportunities. If you'd like to work with me, please send an email to <morphanone@gmail.com>. I can guarantee I'll make it work and hopefully learn something new in the process.
