Hi! I'm Morphan1, the owner of this website, and I guess I'll just put my life story here for now.<br>
I enjoy programming in my spare time. I started getting into it circa 2011, when I started fiddling with HTML and JavaScript.<br><br>
In 2013, I found myself trying to start a small Minecraft server mainly for my friends and I.<br>
I managed to throw together a Bukkit server (the most recommended brand back then) and decided to see what I could add to it.<br><br>
With no knowledge of Java or any other true programming language, I searched for a plugin that allowed scripting.<br>
This lead me to a fantastic plugin called [Denizen](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/denizen/), which in turn lead me to the amazingly helpful IRC channel on EsperNet so I could learn what to do.<br><br>
After a while of Denizen scripting, dScripting if you will, I hit a few walls and felt the urge to get involved with the programming of the plugin.<br>
The plugin's creator and former project leader known as aufdemrand helped me with getting started...<br>
For the longest time, most of what I coded in Java was useless or broken or both. But as I slowly learned from my mistakes, I got better and better.<br><br>
Soon, aufdemrand sadly began to disappear and was succeeded by [an excellent programmer named mcmonkey](http://mcmonkey.org/).<br>
Now here we are. It's 2016 and the Denizen project is a powerhouse with [tens of thousands of lines of code](https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen-For-Bukkit).<br><br>
I've learned C# and become pretty awesome at working with deeply obfuscated code, which generally makes normal programming a cakewalk.<br><br><br>
**TL;DR**: [I'm an experienced developer](https://github.com/Morphan1).
